# Machine-Learning
The project implements a Decision Tree Classifier for classification. The following steps were performed:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing correlations and identifying key features.

Model Training & Evaluation: Training a Decision Tree model with hyperparameter tuning.

Performance Optimization: Applying techniques like cross-validation and feature selection.

User Input Prediction: Taking user inputs, encoding categorical values, and predicting the weather condition.
